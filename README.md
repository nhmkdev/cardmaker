# Critical Google Sheets News

Google policies have changed around accessing user data and Card Maker will be undergoing permission/policy changes starting March 2, 2024. This may dramatically impact the use of Google Sheets.

Google sheets functionality may break completely **OR** they will continue to function using the [1.3.0.0](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/releases/tag/v.1.3.0.0) release of the application (changes how Google Sheets are selected).

You can get the latest information as I work through the process here: https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/issues/123

# CardMaker

CardMaker is an application that generates graphics via data sources. It has a graphical user interface for designing layouts and offers scripting functionality.

This application was created to help me generate components for a board game. You can put all of your variable data into a CSV or Google Spreadsheet and then create layouts in CardMaker. This separates your layout and data so you do not have to manually re-create each card. 

Command line based export support is in development (coming soon!). Soon you will be able to build CardMaker into a workflow!

## Sample

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nhmkdev/cardmaker/readme_sample.png)

The above image was generated by the following input data row from a CSV:

| Count | Name | image | skill1 | skill1value | skill2 | skill2value | ability |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Siani Malia | che.png | T |  3 | B | 4 | Ranged Battle: +1 on all die Rolls @[opt] | 

While there is some interpretation of the data by CardMaker to generate the final result, many of the values are direct references. The layout configuration in CardMaker controls the details of how to actually present the data.

[Further Details on how the Elements for this Layout are configured](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/wiki/user-readme-sample)

## Code Status

Compiles with Visual Studio Community Edition 2019

See more details in the [Developers Section](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/wiki/developers)

[TODO / Wishlist](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/wiki/developers-todo)

Toxicity Level: Medium-High
 * Needs more comments
 * Needs warning cleanup
 * Needs some shuffling to allow for more narrow and focused unit testing
 * Needs more unit tests!
 * Every method should be implemented based on an interface and classes should implement hundreds of interfaces (just kidding!!!)

## The Google Issue

If you plan to outright copy the parts of the code that operate with Google Spreadsheets please be aware that the source
currently uses the client id that is associated with my CardMaker application. [Code File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker/master/CardMaker/Card/Import/GoogleReferenceReader.cs)

You will need to modify this code to correctly use your application.

## Games Developed with CardMaker

CardMaker played some role in the development of these games (prototyping or otherwise). Let me know if you have a game that should be listed here.
